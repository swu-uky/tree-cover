# Tree Cover

## About
This project explores the amount of tree cover worldwide from 1990 - 2015.
Its intent is to visualize the deforestation phenomenon while pinpointing the regions most affected.

## Definitions
For the purposes of this map, "tree cover" refers to natural or planted stands of trees that are at least 5 meters.
It excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems (eg. fruit plantations and agroforestry systems) as well as trees in urban parks and gardens.
Percentages are interpreted as "% of land area".
